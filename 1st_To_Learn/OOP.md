# C++ What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

# C++ What are Classes and Objects?

> Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:

Another example:

So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from the class.
